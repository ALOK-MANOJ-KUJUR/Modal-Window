        Family is the place where you learn your first lesson in life. Your
        family members are the only assets that will remain with you forever.
        Whatever the circumstances, family members are always there for each
        other to support us. Good values and good morals are always taught in a
        family. In the family, we are prepared to respect our elders and love
        younger ones. We learn lessons consistently from our family, about
        honesty, dependability, kindness and so on. Family always provides us
        with a sensation of so much love and care.
